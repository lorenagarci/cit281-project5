# MONSTER GAME

In project 5, I gained experience and enhanced my skills in various areas of programming. 

I worked with classes which includes working with class constructors to initialize objects and implementing methods to define the behavior of those objects. In this project I was able to deepen my understanding of code modules, practiced the usage and explored the benefits in code organization and reusability.

I became more proficient in executing and debugging Node.js code using VSCode which involves using debugging tools. I also expanded my knowledge of Array map() and forEach() methods. These methods provided powerful ways to iterate over arrays, transforming and manipulating their elements.

This project revolves around creating a Monster Game program using classes. The game involved the creation of monsters with initial life values and minimum life thresholds for survival. I developed a fun and interactive game but also enhanced my programming skills across multiple domains.
